// For each of the KEYs (left side) create a TRANSLATIONS FILE ENTRY.
// Editing the keys or values in this file, other than simply reordering, could potentially
// cause the plugin to stop functioning or produce errors that I will not troubleshoot.
// Please refer to your better judgement before editing.

// Possible config options are: rpg/survivormenu.cfg or rpg/infectedmenu.cfg.
// Talents use the "part of menu named?" key which refers to the left column names to determine
// which sub-menu in-game that they appear under.
// You can add as many options as you want, here. It'll simply create multiple pages in the menu.

// For the "rpg/points.cfg" you can also do the same as with the talent options, by specifying in
// that config what loads where. How cool is that :)
