// "ability trigger?" values:
//	"A"	-	Infected Abilities, such as hunter pounce or a spitter spitting
//	"a"	-	Triggers when the player spawns
//	"b"	-	Drops spitter goo on the player when bile wears off of them
//	"c"	-	Depends on the chance roll ability (Excluding this char from "ability trigger?" means a die won't roll to determine if it fires)
//	"C"	-	Triggers when a survivor kills a common (or uncommon) infected.
//	"D"	-	Damaging a player on the opposite team
//	"d"	-	Damaging a player on the same team. (Abilities like healing bullets)
//	"E"	-	Triggers when the player dies
//	"e"	-	Triggers when the player kills another player.
//	"h"	-	Rolls the chance roll a second time.
//	"H"	-	Triggers when a player is shoved by a player on the opposite team.
//	"i"	-	Triggered when a player tags someone (such as being biled on, grabbed by a smoker, etc. "tag ability?" is the key.
//	"I"	-	Triggered when a player is tagged by someone.
//	"j"	-	Triggered when a player jumps while they DO NOT have an active victim (or while they are not a victim) (Does not trigger if they are not touching the ground.)
//	"J"	-	Triggered when a player jumps while they have an active victim (ex: They're a jockey, riding a survivor, and they press their jump key.)
//	"l"	-	Damaged by a player on the same team.
//	"L"	-	Damaged by a player on the opposite team.
//	"m"	-	Triggers when a survivor player is incapacitated. The infected player triggers this ability, but if the player who incaps isn't the survivors ensnare (person who has them pounced, etc.) target, the ensnare target can trigger their ability in this way, too.
//	"M"	-	Triggers when (and for) the infected player who has just released a survivor they had ensnared, whether through the survivor dying, or the infected player being forced to stop.
//	"n"	-	Triggers when a survivor player (or a tank (i.e. during tank death animation)) is incapacitated AND for survivors, IF the survivor isn't an infected player's active victim (i.e. not pounced, charged, etc.)
//	"N"	-	Triggers when a survivor player is incapacitated AND currently a victim (i.e. pounced, charged, etc.) of an infected player.
//	"p"	-	Periodic (Timer)
//	"P"	-	Charger Impact
//	"s"	-	Triggers when a player shoves a player on the opposite team.
//	"T"	-	Triggers when spit deals damage
//	"t"	-	Triggers when a survivor player damages an infected player who currently has a survivor victim ensnared.
//	"v"	-	Requires having a survivor player as a victim (i.e. having a survivor player pounced.)
//	"V"	-	Requires being an infected players victim


// You can now mix abilities that rely on percentages (such as slowing abilities) with abilities that rely on base units! Here's the conversion rates:
// If the talent is in units, Under 100.0 units is value * 0.01, Under 1000.0 is value * 0.001, Under 10000.0 is value * 0.0001
// This means if bean bag is 32.0 units / point and a player has 10 points, it's 320.0 total units, so if I have slowing on there as well, slowing will be 0.32 (320.0 * 0.001) @ 32%


// "survivor ability effects?" and "infected ability effects?" values:
//	"a"	-	Adrenaline
//	"b"	-	Bean bag effect
//	"B"	-	Blind effect
//	"c"	-	Creates fire on the location of the player, that dissipates after a time, based on the number of talents in the ability
//	"C"	-	Chance roll ability (So it's only used to determine a players roll chance on abilities triggering)
//	"d"	-	Damage is increased (by ability strength) TEMPORARILY (based on ability time)
//	"e"	-	Beacons are created
//	"f"	-	Creates fire on the origin of the player
//	"g"	-	Modifies the player gravity temporarily
//	"h"	-	Heals the player
//	"H"	-	Health modifier
//	"i"	-	Bile (the player is covered in bile as if a boomer biled or exploded on them)
//	"j"	-	Forces the player to jump. Forces the victim to jump, too, if the player has one.
//	"k"	-	Instantly kills the target
//	"l"	-	Makes the player transparent; such as a cloaking device. (The higher the value the more cloaked a player is)
//	"m"	-	Player takes damage based on the value
//	"o"	-	Absorbs damage instead of receiving it (essentially, a shield.)
//	"p"	-	Modifies movement speed
//	"R"	-	Reflects damage
//	"s"	-	Slowing effect
//	"S"	-	Stagger effect
//	"t"	-	Spit is dropped on the target
//	"T"	-	Heals the target
